# Hurricanes
Class creacts mock hurricanes and a class Manipulates and sifts through them.


Further things have been done that I did not want to share. Why? It was truly crappy design with lots of bugs.

An appelet was created to show the hurricanes on a lattitude and longitude GUI. A dot on a map of USA showing every occurance. 
This could be done better by using Swing.

And actually hooking up a data ingestion to this would be better than just randomly generating all the huricanes.
